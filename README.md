# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Each row in the dataset represents a credit card transaction with multiple features.
The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Dataset

- Highly imbalanced target variable (Class)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Key Learnings
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Importance of evaluation metrics
- Model comparison for fraud detection

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
